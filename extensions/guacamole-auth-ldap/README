 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
project page:
 
    http://sourceforge.net/projects/guacamole/files/

Distribution-specific documentation is provided on the Guacamole wiki:

 What is guacamole-auth-ldap?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-ldap is a Java library for use with the Guacamole web
application to provide LDAP based authentication.

guacamole-auth-ldap provides an authentication provider which can be
set in guacamole.properties to allow LDAP authentication of Guacamole
users. Additional properties are required to configure the LDAP
connection and search parameters.

Schema files are provided to create the required object classes in your
LDAP directory.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-ldap
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-ldap is built using Maven. Building guacamole-auth-ldap
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be installed in the library directory configured in
guacamole.properties such that the authentication provider is available.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

2) Copy the .jar file into the library directory specified in your
   guacamole.properties

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.

3) Set up your LDAP server to authenticate Guacamole users

    Schema files are provided in the doc directory for creating
    the "guacConfig" object class required.

    You must add guacConfig objects to your LDAP directory. Each
    guacConfig represents a connection configuration, which is made
    up of a protocol and any number of protocol-specific parameters.

4) Configure guacamole.properties for LDAP

    There are additional properties required by the LDAP authentication
    provider which must be added/changed in your guacamole.properties:

    # Use LDAP authentication
    auth-provider: net.sourceforge.guacamole.net.auth.ldap.LDAPAuthenticationProvider

    # Configuration for LDAP connection
    ldap-hostname:           LDAP_SERVER_HOSTNAME
    ldap-port:               389

    # The attribute which uniquely identifies users
    ldap-username-attribute: uid

    # The base DN which, when appended to the user identifier attribute,
    # produces the full DN of the user being authenticated.
    ldap-user-base-dn:       ou=people,dc=example,dc=net

    # The base DN within which all guacConfig objects can be found.
    ldap-config-base-dn:     dc=example,dc=net

    # The base DN within which all role based groups can be found.
    ldap-group-base-dn:      ou=groups,dc=example,dc=net
    
    
    # The ldap filter which appended to the base DN and user identifier attribute,
    # produces the full DN of the user being authenticated.
    ldap-user-filter: (memberOf=cn=exampleGroup,ou=groups,dc=example,dc=net)
