 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Source archives and pre-built .jar files are available from the downloads
section of the project website:
 
    http://guacamole.incubator.apache.org/

A full manual is available as well:

 What is guacamole-auth-jdbc?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-jdbc is a Java library for use with the Guacamole web
application to provide database-driven authentication.

guacamole-auth-jdbc provides multiple authentication provider implementations
which each provide a support for a different database. These authentication
providers can be set in guacamole.properties to allow authentication of
Guacamole users through that type of database.

Schema files are provided to create the required tables in your database of
choice.


------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-jdbc
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-jdbc is built using Maven. Building guacamole-auth-jdbc compiles
all classes and packages them into a redistributable .tar.gz archive.  This
archive contains multiple .jar files, each of this corresponds to a
database-specific authentication provider implementation that can be installed
in the library directory configured in guacamole.properties.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

4) Extract the .tar.gz file now present in the target/ directory, and
   place the .jar files from the extracted database-specific subdirectory in
   the library directory specified in guacamole.properties.

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.

5) Set up your database to authenticate Guacamole users

    A schema file is provided in the schema directory for creating
    the guacamole authentication tables in your database of choice.

    Additionally, a script is provided to create a default admin user
    with username 'guacadmin' and password 'guacadmin'. This user can 
    be used to set up any other connections and users.

6) Configure guacamole.properties for your database

    There are additional properties required by JDBC drivers which must
    be added/changed in your guacamole.properties. These parameters are
    specific to the database being used.

    For MySQL, the following properties are available:

    # Database connection configuration
    mysql-hostname:           database.host.name
    mysql-port:               3306
    mysql-database:           guacamole.database.name
    mysql-username:           user
    mysql-password:           pass

    Optionally, the authentication provider can be configured
    not to allow multiple users to use the same connection
    at the same time:

    mysql-disallow-simultaneous-connections: true

    For PostgreSQL, the properties are the same, but have different prefixes:

    # Database connection configuration
    postgresql-hostname:      database.host.name
    postgresql-port:          5432
    postgresql-database:      guacamole.database.name
    postgresql-username:      user
    postgresql-password:      pass

    postgresql-disallow-simultaneous-connections: true
