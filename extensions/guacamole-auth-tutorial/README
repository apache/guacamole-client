 About this README
------------------------------------------------------------

This README is intended to provide quick and to-the-point documentation for
technical users intending to compile parts of Guacamole themselves.

Distribution-specific packages are available from the files section of the main
project page:

Distribution-specific documentation is provided on the Guacamole wiki:

 What is guacamole-auth-tutorial?
------------------------------------------------------------

guacamole-auth-tutorial is a Java library for use with the Guacamole web
application which shows a tutorial authentication provider.



------------------------------------------------------------
 Compiling and installing guacamole-auth-tutorial
------------------------------------------------------------

This is built using Maven. Building it
compiles all classes and packages them into a redistributable .jar file. This
.jar file can be installed in the library directory configured in
guacamole.properties such that the authentication provider is available.

1) Run mvn package

    $ mvn package

    Maven will download any needed dependencies for building the .jar file.
    Once all dependencies have been downloaded, the .jar file will be
    created in the target/ subdirectory of the current directory.

    If this process fails, check the build errors, and verify that the
    contents of your settings.xml file is correct.

2) Extract the .tar.gz file now present in the target/ directory, and
   place the .jar files in the extracted lib/ subdirectory in the library
   directory specified in guacamole.properties.

    You will likely need to do this as root.

    If you do not have a library directory configured in your
    guacamole.properties, you will need to specify one. The directory
    is specified using the "lib-directory" property.


3) Configure guacamole.properties

    Certain properties are needed for this tutorial authentication provider to run
    
    # Username and password
    tutorial-user:     tutorial
    tutorial-password: password

    # Connection information
    tutorial-protocol:   vnc
    tutorial-parameters: hostname=localhost, port=5900


5) Restart Tomcat

    The guacamole.properties file as well as any authentication provider .jar
    files are only read when Tomcat starts. This goes for any other servlet
    container as well.

    You must restart Tomcat before any of the above changes can take effect.
