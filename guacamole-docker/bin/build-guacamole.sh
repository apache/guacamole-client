## @fn build-guacamole.sh
##
## Builds Guacamole, saving "guacamole.war" and all applicable extension .jars
## using the guacamole-client source contained within the given directory.
## Extension files will be grouped by their associated type, with all MySQL
## files being placed within the "mysql/" subdirectory of the destination, all
## PostgreSQL files being placed within the "postgresql/" subdirectory of the
## destination, etc.
##
## @param BUILD_DIR
##     The directory which currently contains the guacamole-client source and
##     in which the build should be performed.
##
## @param DESTINATION
##     The directory to save guacamole.war within, along with all extension
##     .jars.  Note that this script will create extension-specific
##     subdirectories within this directory, and files will thus be grouped by
##     extension type.
