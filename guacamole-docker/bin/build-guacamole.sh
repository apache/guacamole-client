## @fn build-guacamole.sh
##
## Builds Guacamole, saving "guacamole.war" and all applicable extension .jars
## using the guacamole-client source contained within the given directory.
## Extension files will be grouped by their associated type, with all MySQL
## files being placed within the "mysql/" subdirectory of the destination, all
## PostgreSQL files being placed within the "postgresql/" subdirectory of the
## destination, etc.
##
## @param BUILD_DIR
##     The directory which currently contains the guacamole-client source and
##     in which the build should be performed.
##
## @param DESTINATION
##     The directory to save guacamole.war within, along with all extension
##     .jars.  Note that this script will create extension-specific
##     subdirectories within this directory, and files will thus be grouped by
##     extension type.
##
## @param BUILD_PROFILE
##     The build profile that will be passed to Maven build process. Defaults
##     to empty string. Can be set to "lgpl-extensions" to e.g. include
##     RADIUS authentication extension.
