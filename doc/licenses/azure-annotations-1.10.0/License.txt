NOTE: The above has been extracted from the source of the "azure-annotations"
library, as may be downloaded from Maven Central:

https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/microsoft/azure/azure-annotations/1.10.0/azure-annotations-1.10.0-sources.jar

Unfortunately, the "License.txt" file noted is not included with the source
.jar, and the GitHub repository referenced by the pom.xml of
"azure-annotations" is not publicly visible:

https://github.com/Microsoft/java-api-annotations

I (Mike Jumper) have reached out to Microsoft to correct this and to request a
copy of the "License.txt" file if access to this repository cannot be fixed in
the near future. Until then, the above should serve as reasonable confirmation
that this library is indeed (1) licensed under the MIT license and (2)
copyright Microsoft Corporation.
