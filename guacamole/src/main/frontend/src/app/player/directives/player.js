/**
 * Directive which plays back session recordings. This directive emits the
 * following events based on state changes within the current recording:
 *
 *     "guacPlayerLoading":
 *         A new recording has been selected and is now loading.
 *
 *     "guacPlayerError":
 *         The current recording cannot be loaded or played due to an error.
 *         The recording may be unreadable (lack of permissions) or corrupt
 *         (protocol error).
 *
 *     "guacPlayerProgress"
 *         Additional data has been loaded for the current recording and the
 *         recording's duration has changed. The new duration in milliseconds
 *         and the number of bytes loaded so far are passed to the event.
 *
 *     "guacPlayerLoaded"
 *         The current recording has finished loading.
 *
 *     "guacPlayerPlay"
 *         Playback of the current recording has started or has been resumed.
 *
 *     "guacPlayerPause"
 *         Playback of the current recording has been paused.
 *
 *     "guacPlayerSeek"
 *         The playback position of the current recording has changed. The new
 *         position within the recording is passed to the event as the number
 *         of milliseconds since the start of the recording.
