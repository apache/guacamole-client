        The namespace prefix to apply to all translation strings within the
        given object, if any. This parameter is optional. If omitted, an empty

        some translations (those provided by Guacamole extensions) are used as

        application level. If no "NAME" key is present, `lang_name` will be
        `None`.
    strings : dict
        The flattened set of translation key/value pairs. Each key will contain
        all applicable namespaces, separated by periods, as produced by
